# Flask Apps
This repository is where I keep all of my flask apps for development or experimentation. 

## Kitsu App
### Requirements
- Python 3.10.0

**To Do**
1. Add operator and machine time differentiator
2. Incorporate multiple versions so Jonny and Raad can choose which design they prefer

**Questions**
- How do we measure cycle times without engineer?
- What should we use the BLE tags for?
	- Syncing location of operator with timestamps?
- Cassidy to add extra button for operator timing
	- What are some other design patterns for this?

## Flask API
This Flask app is meant for experimenting with Next.js. Mostly just an example.
